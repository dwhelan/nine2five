A Ruby workflow engine

# Principles

## Composable
We want to create components that can be connected into useful workflows and reused across different workflows.

## Portable
Workflow items should independent of software languages and use accepted standards for sharing data such as JSON, YAML. XML etc.

## Light Weight
This is not SOAP, BPEL, BMPN. However, architecture should allow co-existence

## Agnostic
Agnostic about
- persistence
- liveness (treads, fiber, processes etc.)
